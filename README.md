# Neural-netowrks-and-deep-learning-hws
This repository contains three different assignments of the course "Neural networks and deep learning" held by professor Testolin for the master degree in physics of data. 
Three main topics are covered 
- Supervised learning with the implementation of a deep neural network for a regression problem and a convolutional nn for a classification problem;
- Unsupervised learning implementing an autoencoder for images and a generative adversarial network;
- Reinforcement learning with the implementation of the cart-pole training game and acrobot from the gym environment 

These models were actually written in pytorch.
